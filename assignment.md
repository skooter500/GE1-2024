![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this assignment you will use your creativity, and demonstrate competency with Godot and git by designing and creating a holographic musical instrument. Some ideas:

- Tin-whistle or flute with finger tracking
- Air guitar
- Dance and movement that activates sound
- Step sequencer
- Piano
- DJ Deck
- Drums
- Analogue synth made with oscillators
- Rhythm game like beat saber
- An accordian
- A theramin
- Concertina

There are several examples in this repository you can try out for inspiration.
You can use CSG Shapes or use Blender

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Complexity | 33% | Complex, generative, procedural sound generation such as a sequencer or synthesiser or algorithmically created instrument. Use of audio buses and programmable audio effects.  UI created procedurally from files. Highly customisable and configurable. Lots of variety in the sounds created. A live performance. Use of lots of systems in Godot such as materials, shaders, animations, tweens and interactions, particle systems. A lot of new nodes created. The instrument is "programmable". Sound is generated procedurally. Excellent visual feedback. Use of SOLID principals | Simple UI based on buttons to make sounds. Use of loops and at least one array. Use of timers. UI is generated in editor.  Good variety of sounds. Based on a real instrument. Several new nodes created. | A basic soundboard with buttons to make sounds | Forked the repo, made some commits, not much working, but it makes a sound | Failed to fork the repo, no commits made |
| Aesthetic | 33% | Novel user interface for creating live sound. Complex button and knob arrangement. High quality of visual design. Original, high quality assets produced. Original recorded audio or audio generated especially for the project. Visually coherent and easy to use. Great variety of musical expressiveness. Sounds are interesting and coherent. Crazy and beautiful and lots of novelty. Use of a good variety of interactions - movement, sliders, buttons | Straightforward, intuitive interface with a reasonable amount of control of a good range of sound. Ability to perform live with a good degree of expression. Some simple assets created. | Basic interface with one scene. Some assets made and some acquired from online sources. Not too much variety in the expressiveness of the instrument | Simple or unintuitive user interface. User interface made from premade assets. Sound are premade or made using simple tools | Basic user interface that makes sound, without any expressiveness or novelty or much fun. | Project doesnt make any sound
| Documentation | 33% | Large number of commits. Good quality video demo and good documentation, with all sections completed. Commits evenly spaced throughout the project | Smaller number of commits over a shorter period of time, but a good bit of work evident in the latter weeks of the project. Video and documentation completed to high standard | All done in week or two before the delivery date. Lots of commits in last two weeks. Documentation incomplete or video incomplete. | All done in the final week. Incomplete documentation or video. Few commits | No use of git. project doesnt work |

This is a playlist of last years assignments for inspiration:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJX0uuLm0p8&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E7D7rshySTrbooGSEGWqaJE
- Musical instruments made in Godot by first year students

- Final submission will be an in class demo/performance
- A git repo with commits, with comments as you make progress
- The readme file in your repo will be in this format.
- Youtube video demo embedded into your readme file.
